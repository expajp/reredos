# Reredos

Reredos is the email address validator, which is free from [ReDoS Attack](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS).

You can examine if an email address is based on [RFC1035](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt) and [RFC5321](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5321.txt).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'reredos'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install reredos

## Usage
```ruby
Reredos.valid_email?('user@example.com')
# => true

Reredos.valid_email?('user@@example.com')
# => false
```

## Development

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
